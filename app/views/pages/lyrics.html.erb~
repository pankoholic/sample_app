        <h1>The 4 Skins - Chaos</h1>      
        <p>
        Do you remember in 1969?<br>
        Seeing all the skinheads standing in a line<br>
        Foaming at the mouth, Waiting for a fight<br>
        High boots, cropped hair, what a fuckin sight<br>
        <br>
        Come back of the skinhead, come back of the boot<br>
        People that we don't beat up, We're gonna fucking shoot<br>
        We are the new breed, we will have our say<br>
        we are the new breed, we ain't gonna die<br>
        <br>
        Trouble east London, trouble in the street<br>
        On the street corners, where the gang still meets<br>
        Talking about the weekend, what they're gonna do?<br>
        If you aint careful, they are gonna do you!<br>
        <br>
        Come back of the skinhead, come back of the boot<br>
        People that we don't beat up, We're gonna fucking shoot<br>
        We are the new breed, we will have our say<br>
        we are the new breed, we ain't gonna die<br>
        <br>
        Chaos in the city, civil war now<br>
        Skinheads taking over, like skinheads know how<br>
        Skinhead with his boots on, nobodys fool<br>
        Skinheads taking over, chaos is the rule!<br>
        <br>
        Chaos, chaos, chaos - dont give a toss<br>
        Chaos, chaos, chaos - dont give a toss!<br>
